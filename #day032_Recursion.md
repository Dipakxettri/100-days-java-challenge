# Day 32 : Recursion in Java
## What is Recursion in Java
Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem until it reaches a base case where the solution is straightforward. Recursion can be used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems.

### Key Concepts

- **Base Case:** A condition in the recursive method that terminates the recursion. It prevents the method from calling itself indefinitely.
- **Recursive Case:** The part of the method where it calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the problem.
- **Stack Overflow:** Recursion must be managed carefully to avoid stack overflow errors, which occur when the recursive calls consume more stack space than available.

### Example:
```java
public class RecursionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = factorial(5);
        System.out.println("Factorial of 5 is: " + result);
    }

    public static int factorial(int n) {
        // Base case
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        // Recursive case
        else {
            return n * factorial(n - 1);
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, the factorial method calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. The base case (n == 0 or n == 1) terminates the recursion, and the recursive case (return n * factorial(n - 1)) calls the method with a smaller input until it reaches the base case.

### Benefits:
- **Simplicity:** Recursion can simplify the implementation of certain algorithms by breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
- **Readability:** Recursive solutions can often be more readable and intuitive for problems inherently defined in terms of smaller sub-problems.

### Considerations:
- **Performance:** Recursive solutions may not always be the most efficient due to the overhead of function calls and stack usage. Iterative solutions can sometimes be more efficient.
- **Stack Limitation:** Java has a limited stack size, so deep recursion may lead to StackOverflowError.

Recursion is a powerful technique that can elegantly solve many problems in programming. It's important to understand when to use recursion and how to implement it correctly to avoid common pitfalls.
