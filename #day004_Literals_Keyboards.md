# Day 4: Introduction to Data Types, literals and Keyboards in Java

Today's lesson introduced fundamental data types, Literals and keyboards in Java.

## Data Types
- **Integer**: Represents whole numbers, such as -10, 0, 42.
- **Float**: Represents decimal numbers, like 3.14f, -0.001f, 100.5f. (Note: Float literals are by default treated as double, so we need to append 'f' to explicitly define them as float.)
- **Char**: Represents single characters, like 'a', '5', '?'.
- **Boolean**: Represents true or false values.
- **String**: Represents sequences of characters, like "Hello", "Java", "123".
- **Long**: Represents integer numbers (64-bit signed), suitable for large integer values. To define long literals, we append 'L' or 'l' to the value.
- **Short**: Represents integer numbers (16-bit signed), suitable for small integer values.
- **Double**: Represents decimal numbers (64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point), suitable for double-precision floating-point values. Double literals don't require any suffix.

## Literals in Java
In Java, a literal represents a fixed value in the source code. It's a way to directly include data within your program without having to calculate or retrieve it from somewhere else.

### Integer Literals
Integer literals represent whole numbers without any fractional or decimal part.
```java
int myIntLiteral = 42;
int negativeIntLiteral = -10;
int zeroIntLiteral = 0;
```

### Float Literals
Float literals represent decimal numbers. They are by default treated as double, so we need to append 'f' to explicitly define them as float.
```java
float myFloatLiteral = 3.14f;
float negativeFloatLiteral = -0.001f;
float bigFloatLiteral = 100.5f;
```

### Char Literals
Char literals represent single characters enclosed in single quotes.
```java
char myCharLiteral = 'a';
char digitCharLiteral = '5';
char specialCharLiteral = '?';
```

### Boolean Literals
Boolean literals represent true or false values.
```java
boolean isTrueLiteral = true;
boolean isFalseLiteral = false;
```

### String Literals
String literals represent sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes.
```java
String myStringLiteral = "Hello";
String numberStringLiteral = "123";
```

### Long Literals
Long literals represent integer numbers (64-bit signed). We append 'L' or 'l' to the value.
```java
long myLongLiteral = 123456789L;
long bigLongLiteral = 9876543210L;
```

### Short Literals
Short literals represent integer numbers (16-bit signed).
```java
short myShortLiteral = 100;
short negativeShortLiteral = -50;
```

### Double Literals
Double literals represent decimal numbers (64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point). Double literals don't require any suffix.
```java
double myDoubleLiteral = 3.14159;
double negativeDoubleLiteral = -2.71828;
```

These examples showcase different literals for each data type along with the suffixes 'f' and 'L' for float and long literals.

# Keywords in Java

In Java, keywords are special words with predefined meanings. They're like building blocks for your code. For example:class,for among other.
