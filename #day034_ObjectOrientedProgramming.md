# Day 34 : Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

## What is OOP?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design software. Objects are instances of classes, which can contain data (fields or attributes) and methods (functions or procedures).

### What is DRY?
DRY : Do Not Repeate Code.

## we can identify the components of Opps as follows:

- **Class :** Employee
- **Attributes :** name,age,salary,class 
- **Methods :** getName(),setName()
### Key Concepts of OOPS:
1. **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. A class defines attributes and methods that the created objects will have.
2. **Object**: An instance of a class. Objects are the basic runtime entities in an object-oriented system.
3. **Inheritance**: One class can inherit attributes and methods from another.
4. **Polymorphism**: One method can work in different ways for different classes.
5. **Encapsulation**: Hides data inside a class and only allows it to be changed through methods.
6. **Abstraction**: Shows only important details and hides complex code.

Thanks for your attention Happy coding.❤️❤️
