# Day_2 of Java Programming 🔥👨🏻‍💻

Hello everyone, I'm Deepak Ghimire, passionate about IT. This is day two of my 100-day Java learning challenge. I'm committed to completing this challenge, hoping it motivates me and helps others.

Here’s what I learned today:

## Basic Structure of a Java Program:
- Explored the basic structure of a Java program, including essential components like classes and the `main` method.

**Syntax:**
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Statements to be executed
    }
}
```
## Key Concepts:
1. **Static**: Means the method or variable belongs to the class itself, not to instances of the class.
2. **Void**: Indicates the method doesn't return any value.
3. **Main**: The starting point of any Java program.
4. **Function**: A block of code that performs a task (called methods in Java).
5. **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects.
6. **Public**: Allows the method or variable to be accessed from other classes.

## Naming Conventions:
1. **Pascal Case**: Used for naming classes. Each word starts with an uppercase letter. Example: `MyClass`, `EmployeeDetails`.
2. **Camel Case**: Used for naming methods and variables. The first word starts with a lowercase letter, and subsequent words start with an uppercase letter. Example: `myMethod`, `employeeName`.


Thanks for your attention, happy coding! 🙏❤️
