# Compiled vs Interpreted Languages

## Compiled Languages
- **Definition**: Translates the entire source code into machine code before execution.
- **Execution**: The resulting machine code is executed directly by the computer's hardware.
- **Speed**: Generally faster execution since the translation occurs before runtime.
- **Examples**: C, C++, Rust.

## Interpreted Languages
- **Definition**: Translates source code into machine code line-by-line or statement-by-statement at runtime.
- **Execution**: No separate machine code file is generated; the interpreter executes the code directly.
- **Speed**: Generally slower execution due to real-time translation.
- **Examples**: Python, JavaScript, Ruby.

## Java: Compiled or Interpreted?
- **Hybrid Approach**: Java is both compiled and interpreted.
  - **Compilation**: Java source code is compiled into bytecode by the Java Compiler (javac).
  - **Interpretation**: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) interprets the bytecode at runtime, allowing for platform independence.

### Conclusion
Java utilizes a combination of compilation and interpretation, providing benefits such as portability and performance.
