# Day_1 of Java Programming üî•üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

As a student who has completed my 12th exams, I have some free time, so I have decided to learn Java. This is my first day learning Java!

By doing this, I am sharing what I learn day by day. It is a 100-day challenge, and I will share my daily progress and knowledge in our IT Student Nepal group and also on GitHub. It may also help others. Here is what I learned today:

## Development of Java:
- Java was created by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s and it was officially released by Sun Microsystems in 1995.

## Working of Java:
- Java code is first compiled into bytecode. This bytecode is then interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to produce machine code.

    | Source code -> Compiled bytecode | Interpreted by JVM | Machine code |

## About JDK and JRE:
- **JDK (Java Development Kit):** A toolkit for Java developers, containing compilers and other tools needed to develop Java applications.
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):** A runtime environment for executing Java applications, including the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and libraries required for running Java programs.

Thanks for your attention, Happy coding! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è
